# Summary 

Eventor is an event planning app that helps you keep track of events
reminders, or things of that nature. Eventor was designed to address the user needs
of efficiently organizing and managing events, tracking attendance, and providing real-time updates,
through text notifications.

## Screens and Features

> Login
> Home Screen / Events Screen
> Edit Event Screen
> Create Event Screen

1. Login Screen allows the user to either loging to Eventor, or create a new account.
2. Events Screen - displays all the events in a list like format for easy view and access.
3. Edit Screen - can be access from the grid screen and is used to adjust data in previously created events.
4. Create Screeen - allows the user to create new events.

## Development Guidelines

The Development of the app was based on an iterative approach. OOP principles 
were applied to promote code reusability and maintainability. Following these
techniques we can enable more efficient iterations in the fututre.

## Testing 

We used a combination of manual and automated testing. Unit test were created
to ensure the functionality was working as intended. This testing process helped
us find and identify bugs and unexpected behaviors.

## Overcoming Challenges

During the app design and development process, one area where innovation was 
required was in establishing a smooth connection with the SQLite database.
Although the process itself was quite simple, we created a very simple wrapper 
to encompass database methods that would make our life easier in the long run.

## Expertise and Experience

I feel where we shine the most is in the implementation of the CRUD functionality.
All updates are instant and the user does not need to refresh, or close the app
to see the changes since they happen fast enough to look immediate.
