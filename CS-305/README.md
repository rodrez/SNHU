### CS 305 Software Security

Artemis Financial is the client which is a financial institution. Their main issues is ensuring the system is a safe one that the customers can trust.

Vulnerability Check:

It checks for vulnerabilities in the code by executing a series of tests and checks against the software. It also scans for potential vulnerabilities and API calls to find out any possible vulnerability.

Dependency Check:

It is one of the identifying software security vulnerabilities because it provides a list of all the libraries that are being used by each application but might not be up-to-date.

Encryption:

Encryption is another identifying software security vulnerability because it makes it difficult for hackers who want to steal sensitive data from your software.

A vulnerability assessment is a systematic evaluation of the status of computer systems, their security and resilience, as well as any potential vulnerabilities that might exist.

I found that the process of working through the vulnerability assessment was helpful because it helped me understand what to look out for while navigating around the codebase. I found this project helpful to do because it made me think about all the places where there are security threats and how I can be more aware of my surroundings in those situations.

With this increasing need to increase layers of security, there are 2 main things that will be taken into account - Vulnerability Check and Dependency Check.

Vulnerability check is essentially a form of identification whereby it checks for the presence or absence of a vulnerability such as malware or virus. Dependency check on the other hand is just in depth investigation on how one service depends on another. This is done to ensure that no important plug-ins are being left out by mistake.

Maven is the most popular dependency manager for Java projects. It associates a group of managed libraries with a project and helps to find errors quickly and easily.

Maven provides a set of conventions that streamline the build process as well as instructions for various tasks such as checking for new versions of dependencies, creating releases, reporting about the project status, etc. Maven also provides some extra goals that can be used to do things like code coverage or unit tests.

If I were to show a part of this assignment to an employer it would be the API endpoint that generates the checksum as I believe it entails various safety practices from implementing a new endpoint to creating the hashing function.
