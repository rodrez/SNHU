## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

A user story is a short, high-level description of the features and functions that a user needs to be able to do with the product. It is not a technical document or detailed requirements specification.

User stories are written in the format of "As a [type of user], I want to [do something] so that [some goal can be achieved]."

The benefit of these stories is that they allow developers and product managers to understand what users need from the product. This helps them build more useful products.

## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Agile development is a methodology that is focused on delivering a working product in short cycles. The goal is to produce a high-quality product in a timely manner.

It is important to identify the needs of your customers and develop solutions that will solve their problems. This will help you create the right product at the right time for your customers, which will lead to customer satisfaction. 

That being said the way I approach new development work will greatly differ to the way I use to. Now I have a better understanding of how I can plan, develop, estimate and much more.
